## Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction is one of the most important applications of data science in business. An effective churn prediction tool can help the business to stop losing customers. In this project, we aim to analyze two datasets provided by Robinhood Company and develop a classification model to predict the churned users. 

### Datasets
The dataset for equity values and customer information has been provided. The company categorizes a user as a churned user when his/her equity value falls below $10 for a period of 28 consecutive calendar days or longer. The first step is to specify the churned users from the equity dataset before building the classification model. The dataset is imbalanced where the churned users are the minority.

### The main steps in this project are as follows:
  - Specifying the churned users based on the definition provided by the company.
  - Dealing with the imbalanced dataset.
  - Building classification model.
